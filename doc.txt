CHANGE APPLICATION PORT:
- if you want to change the port application, you need to change 
-- APP_PORT in .env file and EXPOSE port in dockerfile 
CHANGE UPLOAD DIRECTORY:
- to change upload dir., you need to change UploadLocation in utitile and also change "mountTo" in liara.json 
-- liara supports 100MB free disk in tmp folder. so i'm gonna change the upload folder to tmp for now 
--- but for final deployment, we need to change it to the public folder and buy disk in liara 
(THIS U.UploadLocation has not been implemented yet)
WHY WE DIDN'T USE S3 BUCKET:
- this decision is made by me (@mostafa_bnesh). i thought for future code migration from liara to X, 
-- it would be easier. But if they don't wanna migrate, we may use S3 disk
